# Basic-ML-Model-for-Text-Classification

the task is to build a machine learning model to classify whether a particular tweet is hate speech or not. I'll explain more as you proceed further, so let's start without much ado!

Note: that since we have used very basic NLP features, the classification accuracy and f1 scores aren't that impressive. The goal of this exercise was to make you familiar with the model building process and I hope that you have a better idea on how to build a text classification model.
